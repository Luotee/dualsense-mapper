PadToKBM (formerly DualSense Mapper) is a small Windows app: one ~11 MB `PadToKBM.exe`, no installer, no bundled driver.
It supports **DualSense (PS5), Switch Pro and Switch 2 Pro**, each with its own set of bindings.
It was first written so my wife could play MapleStory Worlds Artale with a controller on a laptop.

The app's interface is in Traditional Chinese; the labels quoted below (「…」) are what you see on screen.
For the current version see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## What it solves

| Problem | What PadToKBM does |
|---|---|
| The game only takes keyboard and mouse | Controller buttons send keys, mouse buttons and the wheel; the DualSense touchpad can move the mouse cursor |
| Editing a config file to bind keys is a pain | Drag: a tile onto a slot binds it, a slot onto another swaps them, a slot dragged out is cleared; undo / redo |
| Not enough buttons | **Quick pages** (快捷頁): while L2 / ZL (or R2 / ZR) is held, the D-pad and the four face buttons become another set of 8 keys |
| Rapid fire or a combo takes many presses | **Macros** (巨集): record presses and releases, optionally looping; every step's delay is a min–max range |
| Afraid of looking like a script or a cheat | Every key timing is randomized, no fixed rhythm; only ordinary Windows key input, no injection, no game changes |
| Stuck keys | Keys held when the controller drops, the app closes or crashes are released |
| Sometimes you want the game to use the controller itself | Top right, per controller: 「關｜鍵鼠｜手把」 (off / keyboard-mouse / controller). 手把 means the app sends nothing and the game uses the controller (the Switch 2 Pro becomes an Xbox controller) |

## Three steps

**1. Download** `PadToKBM.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Luotee/pad-to-kbm/releases/latest) into a folder you can write to (for example `Downloads\PadToKBM\`).

**2. Pair the controller (Bluetooth)**

| Controller | How to pair |
|---|---|
| DualSense | Hold PS and Create until the light bar flashes, then add it in Windows "Bluetooth & devices" |
| Switch Pro | Hold the sync button on top until the lights run, then add it in Windows "Bluetooth & devices" |
| Switch 2 Pro | Do **not** pair it in Windows. With PadToKBM running, hold the small SYNC button the first time; afterwards any button reconnects |

**3. Double-click `PadToKBM.exe`**: once the window is open, press buttons; the keys go to the program in the foreground.
The first run writes a config file `padtokbm.json` next to the exe; the whole folder can be moved to another PC.

## FAQ

### Will it be flagged as a cheat?

It only turns controller buttons into keyboard keys, the same as pressing the keys yourself, using ordinary Windows key input (`SendInput`): no injection, no changes to game files, and it brings no driver of its own.
So it does not look like a script, the hold time (`min_press_ms`), the spread of simultaneous presses (`tick_jitter_ms`) and every macro step's delay are random ranges and cannot be set to a fixed value.
To check for yourself, turn on 「記錄每個按鍵事件」 (log every key event) in Settings: every key sent is written with its time to `padtokbm-events.log` next to the config (past 1 MB it becomes `.log.1` and a new file starts).

### The Switch 2 Pro is connected but the game does nothing?

Look at 「關｜鍵鼠｜手把」 at the top right (on the Switch 2 Pro the third segment reads 「Xbox」):

- **鍵鼠** (keyboard-mouse, the default): buttons send keys and mouse input; nothing else needed.
- **Xbox**: PadToKBM turns it into a virtual Xbox controller for the game, which needs
  [ViGEmBus 1.22.0](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases/tag/v1.22.0). If this PC does not have it, picking Xbox shows a prompt;
  「安裝 ViGEmBus」 (Install ViGEmBus) downloads the official installer, checks the file and runs it (it asks for administrator rights).
- **關** (off): this controller sends nothing for now; restarting the app brings it back.

Windows 11 is recommended (Windows 10's Bluetooth limits it to about 17 Hz).

### Where is the config? Can I edit it directly?

`padtokbm.json` next to the exe. Settings → 一般 (General) has 「用記事本開啟」 (Open in Notepad); save the file and the app applies it. The top of the file lists the valid key names.

### Upgrading from DualSense Mapper (v3.0.0 or earlier): do I lose my settings?

No. Put `PadToKBM.exe` in the old folder and delete the old `dualsense-mapper.exe`; on the first run the old `dualsense-mapper.json`
is renamed to `padtokbm.json`, and a backup `dualsense-mapper.json.bak` is kept.

### Can I turn the controller off when I'm not using it?

Yes, click the power button next to the controller's name. The pairing is kept; press PS / HOME to reconnect.
To let the game use the controller directly (no key mapping) pick 手把; to stop it sending anything for a while pick 關.

### USB, DualSense Edge, Xbox controllers or macOS?

Not yet: Bluetooth only, Windows only. A macOS build is planned; until then macOS can use the old Python program in [`legacy-python/`](legacy-python/README.md) (DualSense only).

Command-line flags (mainly for debugging): `--config PATH`, `--validate`, `--dry-run` (print the keys it would send, press nothing), `--list-buttons`, `--verbose`, `--cli` (the old console mode), `--no-pause`.

Every controller's `buttons` table in the config must list button ids 0–32; which button each id is: see `label` in [`rust/config.example.json`](rust/config.example.json).
Contribution rules and the design rules that must not break: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
