//! Gamepad event source abstraction.
//!
//! v2.0.0 onwards: DualSense BT raw HID only via `hidapi`. The v1.x
//! gilrs path has been removed. v2.6.0 adds the Switch 2 Pro BLE worker;
//! `GamepadSource` is the `hub::SourceHub` that lets one of the two
//! workers own the session at a time. See
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-v2.0.0-raw-hid-dualsense-design.md`
//! for the design.
