//! Names of the files that sit beside the exe, and the one-time adoption of
//! the pre-v3.1.0 names (the app was called DualSense Mapper until then).
//!
//! Adoption runs only when the new file is missing and the old one exists:
//! the old file is copied to `<old>.bak`, then renamed to the new name (same
//! directory, so the rename is atomic). It never overwrites a new file and
//! never fails startup: on any error the old file is left as it was and the
//! caller reads it in place.
