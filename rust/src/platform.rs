//! Platform-specific controller power control.
//!
//! The DualSense HID protocol has **no** power-off / shutdown / disconnect
//! command. Verified against the nondebug/dualsense reverse-engineering
//! reference: every output report (0x02/0x05/0x31/0xa0/…) only drives
//! haptics, adaptive triggers, the light bar, the speaker, and the player
//! LEDs. The PS5 console powers a pad off at the **Bluetooth link layer**
//! (it terminates the ACL link), not via HID — the pad, having lost its
//! bonded host, then powers itself down.
//!
//! So "turn off the controller" from a PC means dropping the Bluetooth
//! *link* through the OS Bluetooth stack — **without** removing the
//! pairing. The right primitive is the `IOCTL_BTH_DISCONNECT_DEVICE`
//! control code (bthioctl.h) sent to the local Bluetooth radio: it tears
//! down the ACL link to one remote device but leaves the bond intact, so
//! the pad reconnects on the next PS-button press with no re-pairing. This
//! mirrors what the PS5 console does.
//!
//! (v2.3.0 wrongly used `BluetoothRemoveDevice`, which *unpairs* the pad —
//! far more destructive: the user had to re-pair every time. v2.3.1
//! replaced it with the link-level disconnect below.)
//!
//! This is user-mode Bluetooth *connection management* — not input
//! synthesis, not a driver, not process hooking. It stays within iron
//! rule #7.

/// `IOCTL_BTH_DISCONNECT_DEVICE` from bthioctl.h:

/// FILE_ANY_ACCESS=0)` = `(0x41 << 16) | (0x03 << 2)` = `0x41000C`. Not
